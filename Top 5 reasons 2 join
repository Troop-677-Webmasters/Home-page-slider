<h2>Top 5 Reasons to Join</h2>
<div class="slideshow-container">

<div class="mySlides">
<h1>Largest Troop in the District</h1>
  <p>With over 120 registered scouts, our troop has something for everyone. With a troop this size, even if only a small percentage of the troop attends an event, there is still a group large enough to enjoy the outing. We have over 100 registered adult leaders as well. Everyone does a little to make an active troop thrive.</p>
</div>

<div class="mySlides">
<h1>Many Advancment Opportunities</h1>
  <p>Our troop has counselors for all eagle-required merit badges plus dozens of other interesting ones. We offer a first-year program that aims to lead new scouts through the first three ranks in their first year. From there, we offer Advancement University, as well as opportunities to earn merit badges at many of our monthly campouts.</p>
</div>

<div class="mySlides">
<h1>Over 100 Active Adult Leaders</h1>
  <p>With so many registered adult leaders, everyone has to do a little to get a lot done. It is a relief to know that so many adults are actively working to contribute to our scout's growth in some way. Whether it is teaching a merit badge, mentoring boys, cooking meals or updating names on a website. There is a small job for everyone. Even if some parents do not want to chair a committee, they often help in some way to work on a service project or chaperone an event. By getting involved, parents build long-lasting friendships in the scouting community.</p>
</div>

<div class="mySlides">
<h1>Troop 677 is dedicated to a boy-led Troop</h1>
  <p>This troop emphasis is boy-led. The boys choose and lead the events. Adult leaders are there to support and train youth leaders. We have a saying, "If a boy can do it, a boy should do it." As adults, when scouts come ask us if they can do something at an outing, we inevitably respond by saying what did your senior patrol leader say? We train the scouts to lead other scouts.
</p>
</div>

<div class="mySlides">
<h1>Affordable Scouting Program</h1>
  <p>Our troop is funded partially through matching programs from many area businesses. This allows us to charge nothing for troop dues. Additionally, we have a large fundraising opportunity selling bulk mulch in the Spring. Many scouts earn enough money to pay for all their scouting experience as well as enough for camping equipment and high adventure programs. To top it off, all adults are invited to all campouts free of charge.
